      Hey guys, this is me Mohammad Jawad Barati, I've learned the importance of
      not imitating but rather understanding. Although I can also see why
      imitation is something that we do. It is because when we are a child we
      need to pick up on a lot of skills and imitation can make it a bit lighter
      for us. But when it comes to becoming an original thinker and a creative
      developer it is better to understand and then build stuff that can be
      labeled as our own creation.

      I have had the privilege of working closely with Kasir on two projects
      (last mile delivery, route planning and fleet management for cargo bikes)
      and I can safely say that he is an excellent full stack developer. With
      his ability to ask questions, understand and solve problems, he
      contributes significantly to the success of any development project. He is
      very determined, passionate and resilient. Besides of his technical
      expertise, Kasir is an awesome team player and has a very positive,
      supportive and team-oriented attitude. I am convinced, that he is a great
      addition to any team! Kathi

          Berlin, Germany's capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the
          city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial
          and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War,
          its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of
          reunification. The city's also known for its art scene and modern
          landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie,
          built in 1963.
