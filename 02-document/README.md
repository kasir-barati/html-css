# Intro

_index.html_ usually is the default page that will be shown to the user.

# Outline

- `body` is a section.
- **Sections** create the outline of our HTML document. Some tools will create an outline for us from our HTML documents.
- **Sectioning root**: A node in the tree that represents the root of a new section in document
- **Container**: An element with nested elements inside it, e.g. `body` element or `html` element itself

## `section`

Thematic grouping of content: all the contents inside this element should go together. A general rule is that the `section` element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline.

- Categories: _Flow content_, Sectioning content, Palpable content.
- Contexts in which this element can be used: Where _sectioning content_ is expected.
- Content model: _Flow content_.

## `article`

The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication.

Some content examples that we can put inside an `article` element: This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

- **Self-contained composition**: It is complete in and of itself. Meaning if we separate it and put it in a new document.
- Categories: Flow content, Sectioning content, Palpable content.
- Contexts in which this element can be used: Where sectioning content is expected.
- Content model: Flow content.

## `header`

The `header` element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. This element contains the sections heading elements: but it is not always wrapping h1-6 tags.

- Categories: Flow content, Palpable content.
- Contexts in which this element can be used: Where flow content is expected.
- Content model: Flow content, but with no `header` or `footer` element descendants.

## h1-h6

These elements represent headings for their sections. The heading level corresponds to the levels of nested sections.

- Headings and rank: They define the header of a section, you can markup and specify sections with this element in 2 ways:

1. Implicit: Like what we are doing here with Resume.
2. Explicit: Like how we are marking up the services or skills section's header

## `footer`

It is footer for its nearest sectioning content ancestor.
it is important to note that it is saying "sectioning content ancestor", and not any ancestor!
It contains about its section; who wrote it, license, etc

It is a _Flow content_ and Palpable content.
Cannot use a header or footer element inside it!

## `address`

It represents the contact info for the nearest body or article ancestor.
In this example this address "Schokoladenstra√üe 13, 12134, Berlin" is the contact info for the body, and body is a resume. So this use of address element is correct but do not assume that you can wrap every address with an address tag since its description is clear: "the contact info for the nearest body or article ancestor".

It is a _Flow content_ and Palpable content.

It accepts _Flow content_, but with no heading content descendants, no sectioning content descendants, and no header, footer, or address element descendants.

## `aside`

Tangential content:
It represents a section of our page, and that content is tangentially related to the content around it but also can be considered separate.

It is a _Flow content_, Sectioning content, and Palpable content.
We can use _Flow content_ elements inside it.

For example, if the main content is an article about climate change, an <aside> element might include a brief biography of a climate scientist mentioned in the article or a small fact box about recent climate statistics.
