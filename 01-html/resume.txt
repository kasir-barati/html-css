Hey guys, this is me Mohammad Jawad Barati, I've learned the importance of not imitating but rather understanding. Although I can also see why imitation is something that we do. It is because when we are a child we need to pick up on a lot of skills and imitation can make it a bit lighter for us. But when it comes to becoming an original thinker and a creative developer it is better to understand and then build stuff that can be labeled as our own creation.
