# The wrong way of using `em` element

This is not the correct thought process:

![Wrong mindset of when to use em element](./wrong-mindset-of-when-to-use-em.png)

But you should be thinking like a true HTML author:

![aligned mental model about em according to html spec intrinsically](./aligned-mental-model-about-em-according-to-html-spec-intrinsically.png)

# The wrong way of using `span` element

Here is a marked up document with HTML and it is a meaningful, complying document with the HTML specification.

![Meaningful marked up HTML document](./meaningful-marked-up-html-document.png)

And now you can see the same document, but this time marked up in a way that is wrong:

![Meaningless marked up HTML document](./meaningless-marked-up-html-document.png)
