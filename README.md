# Intro

OK folks, here I am just keeping all the things I am teaching to my bro (Mohammad Sajad Barati) and you can see our meetings in YouTube or Aparat depending on where you are. BTW do not forget to share, like, give a star on GitHub and leave comments so that I can reflect on them.

BTW these videos are all in Persian since my younger brother's English proficiency is not that great (ATM). Also these video are in playlist to make it easier for you guys to watch them in the right order.
