          Hey guys, this is me Mohammad Jawad Barati

          <!-- It represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood -->
          <!-- It is Flow content, Phrasing content, and Palpable content. -->
          <!-- It accepts Phrasing content as its content model. -->
          , I've learned the importance of
          <strong>not imitating but rather understanding</strong>.
          <!-- It represents strong importance, seriousness, or urgency for its contents. -->
          <!-- It is Flow content, Phrasing content, and Palpable content. -->
          <!-- Can be used where phrasing content is expected. -->
          <!-- It accepts Phrasing content as child. -->
          <!-- Different than b element, b element only wants to draw attention without conveying, implying extra importance, seriousness, or urgency! -->
          Although I can also see why imitation is something that we do. It is
          because when we are a child we need to pick up on a lot of skills and
          imitation can make it a bit lighter for us. But when it comes to
          becoming an original thinker and a creative developer it is better to
          understand and then build stuff that can be labeled as our own
          creation.

          <p>
            I have had the privilege of working closely with Kasir on two
            projects (last mile delivery, route planning and fleet management
            for cargo bikes) and I can safely say that he is an excellent full
            stack developer. With <b>his ability to ask questions</b>,
            <!-- It represents a text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance. -->
            <!-- It is Flow content, Phrasing content, and Palpable content. -->
            <!-- You can use it where phrasing content is expected. -->
            <!-- It's content model is: Phrasing content. -->
            <b>understand and solve problems</b>, he contributes significantly
            to the success of any development project.
            <br />
            <!-- It is Flow content. Phrasing content. -->
            He is very determined, passionate and resilient. Besides of his
            technical expertise, Kasir is an awesome team player and has a
            <b>very positive, supportive and team-oriented attitude</b>. I am
            convinced, that <em>he is a great addition to any team!</em>

              The em element also isn't intended to convey importance; for that purpose, the strong element is more appropriate.
