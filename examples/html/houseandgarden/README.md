# Intro

It was not easy, especially where I put `main` element. First it was wrapping the "An easy vanilla cake recipe" section but then I reevaluated my definition of what is the main content in that website and realized that everything else is either side comment or intro. And main content is where it is telling you the **"recipe"**.

Another thing that I discovered during my attempts to markup this website was the fact that I was most of the times thinking visually. Meaning, I was trying to employ HTML as a mean to have similar UI.

The other thing that I learned while I was working on marking up this webpage was that you can put an `img` _tag_ inside `a` or `button` as long as your `img` does not have the `usemap` attribute :sweat_smile::exploding_head:.

I also realized that I was thinking close mindedly. Consciously and unconsciously I was trying to avoid learning new elements, but this was not the end of it, I was even trying to avoid verifying whether my work is conforming or non-conforming. So that's where I learned about [validators](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#how-to-catch-mistakes-when-writing-html:-validators-and-conformance-checkers) and how interesting it is to validate your markup.
