class HumanWorker implements Worker {

class RobotWorker implements Worker {
    work(): void {
        console.log("Robot is working...");
    }

    // The RobotWorker is forced to implement these methods
    // even though it doesn't need or use them.
    eat(): void {
        throw new Error("Robot does not eat!");
    }

    sleep(): void {

            </code>
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <code>RobotWorker</code> class is forced to implement the
          <code>eat()</code>
          and <code>sleep()</code> methods, even though a robot doesn't eat or
          sleep. These methods are irrelevant to the robot, but it has to
          implement them because they are part of the Worker interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          This situation can lead to confusing, error-prone code where the
          <code>RobotWorker</code> either implements these methods with empty
          bodies, throws errors, or does something meaningless, like logging a
          message that it can't perform the action.
