      Hey guys, this is me Mohammad Jawad Barati, I've learned the importance of
      not imitating but rather understanding. Although I can also see why
      imitation is something that we do. It is because when we are a child we
      need to pick up on a lot of skills and imitation can make it a bit lighter
      for us. But when it comes to becoming an original thinker and a creative
      developer it is better to understand and then build stuff that can be
      labeled as our own creation.

        Berlin: A beautiful city that is not like most capitals, I mean crowded
        and with people who are rushing always. But at the same time we have
        many big companies and Startups there.
