# Images

- You can [read the `img` spec in HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-img-element).
  - Categories:
    - Flow content.
    - Phrasing content.
    - Embedded content,
    - Form-associated element.
    - If the element has a usemap attribute: Interactive content.
    - Palpable content.
  - Contexts in which this element can be used:
    - Where embedded content is expected.
    - As a child of a `picture` element, after all source elements.
  - Content model: Nothing.
  - It represents an image.
  - Common attributes:
    - `src`: Address of the resource.
    - `alt`: Replacement text for use when images are not available. This is a must and behaves as if I wanna replace the image with a text.
- In CSS images are [replaced elements](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-3/#replaced-element). Simply put they are elements that are outside of the CSS [formatting model](../14-box-model/README.md#visual-formatting-model) scope.
- Images have natural dimensions; it is when we ain't specifying neither `width` or `height`.
  - If you specify only one of them (`width` or `height`) then it will keep the ratio in a way that your image won't loss its original shape.
