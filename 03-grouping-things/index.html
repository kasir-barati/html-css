          Hey guys, this is me Mohammad Jawad Barati, I've learned the
          importance of not imitating but rather understanding. Although I can
          also see why imitation is something that we do. It is because when we
          are a child we need to pick up on a lot of skills and imitation can
          make it a bit lighter for us. But when it comes to becoming an
          original thinker and a creative developer it is better to understand
          and then build stuff that can be labeled as our own creation.

          <p>
            I have had the privilege of working closely with Kasir on two
            projects (last mile delivery, route planning and fleet management
            for cargo bikes) and I can safely say that he is an excellent full
            stack developer. With his ability to ask questions, understand and
            solve problems, he contributes significantly to the success of any
            development project. He is very determined, passionate and
            resilient. Besides of his technical expertise, Kasir is an awesome
            team player and has a very positive, supportive and team-oriented
            attitude. I am convinced, that he is a great addition to any team!

            Berlin: A beautiful city that is not like most capitals, I mean
            crowded and with people who are rushing always. But at the same time
            we have many big companies and Startups there.
