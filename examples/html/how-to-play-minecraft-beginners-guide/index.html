        Minecraft is a virtual open world video game where players can dig,
        mine, build, craft, and <a href="#">enchant things</a>. The game is
        typically described as a “sandbox game” because players can create their
        own worlds and experiences where the possibilities are truly limitless.
      </p>

      <b>Getting started</b>
      <p>
        Getting started with Minecraft is super easy. First, you need to
        purchase and install the game. After installation is complete, simply
        start the game by running the launcher you downloaded from the
        <a href="#">Minecraft homepage</a>, which also gives you the option to
        play from your browser. Now it’s time to log in, navigate the main menu,
        and select your game type. See our guide for beginners below.
      </p>
      <b>Logging in and the main menu</b>
      <p>
        The launcher opens the News screen, which displays game updates and
        links. Enter your username and password in the lower right corner and
        click Log In to continue to the main menu.
      </p>

          <p>
            This list describes what you can do after you click the buttons on
            the main menu:
          </p>

            <dt><b>SinglePlayer</b></dt>
            <dd>
              Start or continue a basic game. The remaining portion of this
              article covers the options for starting a game in SinglePlayer
              mode.
            </dd>

            <dd>Join other players online.</dd>
            <dt><b>Languages</b></dt>
            <dd>
              Change the language of the text in Minecraft. Use the tiny button,
              just left of the Options button, showing a speech bubble
              containing a globe.
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Options</b></dt>
            <dd>
              Manage game options such as sound, graphics, mouse controls,
              difficulty levels, and general settings.
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Quit Game</b></dt>
            <dd>Close the window, unless you’re in In-Browser mode.</dd>

      <b>Starting your first game in SinglePlayer mode</b>
      <!-- I was about to put the next ol inside the p element because I thought to group them together but then saw in the HTML specification that ol element is not a phrasing content element. -->
      <p>To start your first game in SinglePlayer mode, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol class="black-dots-yellow-numbers-ordered-list">
        <li>
          Click the SinglePlayer button to view a list of all worlds.
          <br />
          If you’re just starting out in Minecraft, this list should be empty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click the Create New World button to start a new game.
          <br />
          The Create New World page appears.
          <img src="#" />
        </li>
        <li>
          In the World Name text box, type whatever name you want and click the
          Create New World button at the bottom of the screen.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When you finish creating your world, the game automatically starts by
        generating the world and placing your <i>avatar</i>
        <small>(character)</small> in it.
      </p>
      <b>Selecting the right game mode in Minecraft </b>
      <p>
        Minecraft offers several different game modes that allow you to
        experience the open world in a unique way. The following types of
        Minecraft game modes are available:
      </p>
      <!-- Name-value groups may be terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, questions and answers, or any other groups of name-value data. -->
      <dl>
        <dt>Survival</dt>
        <dd>
          &mdash; after randomly being spawned in a new world, players have to
          try to survive by gathering material, building shelter,
          <a href="#">gaining experience</a>, and fighting off hostile mobs.
        </dd>
        <dt>Creative</dt>
        <dd>
          &mdash; a game mode where players have immediate access to almost all
          blocks and items, are invulnerable and immune to death, and have the
          ability to fly. The purpose of this game mode is to create/design
          unique worlds.
        </dd>
        <dt>Adventure</dt>
        <dd>
          &mdash; players interact with objects (levers, buttons) and mobs to
          complete an adventure.
        </dd>
        <dt>Spectator</dt>
        <dd>
          &mdash; invisible to everything and cannot interact with blocks,
          entities, or your inventory. This mode is typically used to observe
          other players' created worlds.
        </dd>
        <dt>Hardcore</dt>
        <dd>
          &mdash; similar to survival mode, Hardcore is set to the “hard”
          difficulty level permanently and players cannot respawn; once you die,
          the map is deleted (or you permanently become a spectator).
