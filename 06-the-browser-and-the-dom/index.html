              So basically we just need to check its parent content model to determine its content model.

              But there must be no interactive content descendant, a element descendant, or descendant with the tabindex attribute specified.

        By adding ID which is a global attribute we can add a pound sign at the end of URL and jump to that section. 
        For example this URL will show you the Skills section:
          file:///home/username/html-css/06-the-browser-and-the-dom/index.html#skills 
        Side note that I am on a Linux machine so this file on my local system is located there.

        So the browser is coded to set the scroll position to show that particular element with the "skills" id.

        The id attribute value:
        1. Must be unique amongst all the IDs in the element's tree .
        2. And must contain at least one character. 
        3. The value must not contain any ASCII whitespace.
        
        So in short an element's unique identifier can be used for a variety of purposes, most notably as a way to link to specific parts of a document using fragments.
      -->
      <!-- 
        A URL’s fragment is either null or an ASCII string that can be used for further processing on the resource the URL’s other components identify. It is initially null.

          Hey guys, this is me Mohammad Jawad Barati
          <i lang="fa">(محمد جواد براتی,</i>
          <i lang="jp">ムハンマド ジャヴァド バラティ)</i>, I've learned the
          importance of <strong>not imitating but rather understanding</strong>.
          Although I can also see why imitation is something that we do. It is
          because when we are a child we need to pick up on a lot of skills and
          imitation can make it a bit lighter for us. But when it comes to
          becoming an original thinker and a creative developer it is better to
          understand and then build stuff that can be labeled as our own
          creation.

          <p>
            I have had the privilege of working closely with Kasir on two
            projects (last mile delivery, route planning and fleet management
            for cargo bikes) and I can safely say that he is an excellent full
            stack developer. With <b>his ability to ask questions</b>,
            <b>understand and solve problems</b>, he contributes significantly
            to the success of any development project.
            <br />
            He is very determined, passionate and resilient. Besides of his
            technical expertise, Kasir is an awesome team player and has a
            <b>very positive, supportive and team-oriented attitude</b>. I am
            convinced, that <em>he is a great addition to any team!</em>
