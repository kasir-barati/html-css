      <p>
        Hey guys, this is me Mohammad Jawad Barati, I've learned the importance
        of not imitating but rather understanding. Although I can also see why
        imitation is something that we do. It is because when we are a child we
        need to pick up on a lot of skills and imitation can make it a bit
        lighter for us. But when it comes to becoming an original thinker and a
        creative developer it is better to understand and then build stuff that
        can be labeled as our own creation.

        <p>
          I have had the privilege of working closely with Kasir on two projects
          (last mile delivery, route planning and fleet management for cargo
          bikes) and I can safely say that he is an excellent full stack
          developer. With his ability to ask questions, understand and solve
          problems, he contributes significantly to the success of any
          development project. He is very determined, passionate and resilient.
          Besides of his technical expertise, Kasir is an awesome team player
          and has a very positive, supportive and team-oriented attitude. I am
          convinced, that he is a great addition to any team!

            Berlin, Germany's capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of
            the city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust
            memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during
            the Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol
            of reunification. The city's also known for its art scene and modern
            landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie,
            built in 1963.
