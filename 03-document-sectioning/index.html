<!-- Outline:
  body is a section.
  Sections create the outline of our HTML document.
  Some tools will create an outline for us from our HTML documents.

<!-- Sectioning root: A node in the tree that represents the root of a new section in document -->
<!-- Container: An element with nested elements inside it, e.g. body element or html element itself -->
<!-- Elements represent things; that is, they have intrinsic meaning, also known as semantics. -->

        1. Implicit: Like what we are doing here with Resume.
        2. Explicit: Like how we are marking up the services or skills section's header

      Hey guys, this is me Mohammad Jawad Barati, I've learned the importance of
      not imitating but rather understanding. Although I can also see why
      imitation is something that we do. It is because when we are a child we
      need to pick up on a lot of skills and imitation can make it a bit lighter
      for us. But when it comes to becoming an original thinker and a creative
      developer it is better to understand and then build stuff that can be
      labeled as our own creation.

        In this example this address "Schokoladenstraße 13, 12134, Berlin" is the contact info for the body, and body is a resume. So this use of address element is correct but do not assume that you can wrap every address with an address tag since its description is clear: "the contact info for the nearest body or article ancestor".
