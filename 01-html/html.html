<!-- Hyper Text Markup Language has a dictionary -->
<!-- Semantic: Trying to convey a meaning, describing a document conceptually. -->
<!-- Author: To contribute to write a document. We are adding meaning. So when we add tags we are authoring HTML; and we can be called HTML author -->
<!-- Tags:

-->
<!-- Element: 
  The tag + its content and its attributes.
  Each element is a node in our tree.
  Elements can be nested inside other elements; Be placed inside another element.

<!-- Markups are everywhere: take for instance a docs file and change the extension to zip and try to extract it. Open the extracted folder in VSCode and there you have it, it is a bunch of XML files. -->
<!-- Specification: 
  A precise piece of requirements which is being accepted as a standard.
  We have a specification for all the tech stuff; HTML Specification, CSS Specification, ...
  It is kinda our dictionary.

<!-- Normative: Things that are establishing a standard. -->
<!-- Non-Normative: Things that are not establishing a standard, but rather explaining the spec for us. -->
