    As a software engineer, you're great with computer languages, compilers,
    debuggers, and algorithms. And in a perfect world, those who produce the
    best code are the most successful. But in our perfectly messy world, success
    also depends on how you work with people to get your job done.

  <p class="book-ad__description">
    In this highly entertaining book, Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman
    cover basic patterns and anti-patterns for working with other people, teams,
    and users while trying to develop software.
